	abstract = {We investigate the wave energy potential in the Caribbean Sea using a 30-year wave hindcast. Wave energy in enclosed sea basins, such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, is commonly associated with lower energy production rates. However, an easterly zonal wind reaching 13m/s, known as the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CCLJ), is shown to control the wave climatology in the Caribbean Sea. The wave hindcast information is validated with altimetry (Globwave) and buoy (DIMAR) data from the Colombian Caribbean Sea. The wave hindcast performance is very satisfactory at two buoy locations (Barranquilla and Providencia) and with respect to altimetry information, but presents an underprediction of extreme events at Puerto Bolivar. Therefore, an assessment of wave energy in the study area, based on wave hindcast information, is conducted to investigate the wave energy potential in such enclosed area. Numerical results suggest that the CLLJ region is suitable for wave energy extraction (8–14kW/m) and presents important spatial gradients that need to be considered for the installation of wave energy devices. Furthermore, it is found that locally generated (sea) wave energy can be suitable for energy production and hence future technology development should be devoted to its harvesting.}

	ABSTRACT = {Over recent decades, the exploitation of wave energy resources has sparked a wide range of technologies dedicated to capturing the available power with maximum efficiency, reduced costs, and minimum environmental impacts. These different objectives are fundamental to guarantee the development of the marine wave energy sector, but require also refined assessments of available resource and expected generated power to optimize devices designs and locations. We reviewed here the most recent resource characterizations starting from (i) investigations based on available observations (in situ and satellite) and hindcast databases to (ii) refined numerical simulations specifically dedicated to wave power assessments. After an overall description of formulations and energy metrics adopted in resource characterization, we exhibited the benefits, limitations and potential of the different methods discussing results obtained in the most energetic locations around the world. Particular attention was dedicated to uncertainties in the assessment of the available and expected powers associated with wave&ndash;climate temporal variability, physical processes (such as wave&ndash;current interactions), model implementation and energy extraction. This up-to-date review provided original methods complementing the standard technical specifications liable to feed advanced wave energy resource assessment.},

However, the commercial utilization of wave energy is still very low. This paper reviewed the background of wave energy harvesting technology, its evolution, and the present status of the industry. By covering the theoretical formulations, wave resource characterization methods, hydrodynamics of wave interaction with the wave energy converter, and the power take-off and electrical systems, different challenges were identified and discussed. Solutions were suggested while discussing the challenges in order to increase awareness and investment in wave energy industry as a whole.},

	abstract = {Abstract The sustained development of wave energy in the past two decades makes it one of the most promising renewable energy resources to be added to the diverse mixture of supply systems. The inherent difficulty of grid integration of wave energy involves various aspects such as suitable control of power converters and power conditioning processes, allowing for the extraction of the best quality power. This paper presents a comprehensive review of different aspects of grid integration of wave energy devices, including classification of wave energy devices based on their impacts on grid integration, grid requirements imposed by the grid codes and storage technologies used for the grid integration of wave energy converters (WECs). This study also analyses various grid integration studies on wave energy converters, with particular emphasis on power converter technology and control. Furthermore, specific attention is given to the combinational studies that use wave energy combined with other renewable resources due to their positive synergies in lowering the costs of energy produced and that hold an opportunity for future research. An economic case is presented for wave energy devices based on value on the grid.}

	abstract = {This paper presents an extensive fault analysis for DC microgrids based on accurate representation of DC microgrid components. The DC microgrid incorporates photovoltaic system and wind energy system as renewable energy sources, batteries as energy storage devices, and constant power loads as a typical loading profile in DC systems. As a practical issue, all renewable energy sources are controlled for maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Also, various interfacing topologies for AC sources are investigated. Since grounding issue is crucial in fault behavior, the studied microgrid considered possible grounding schemes. During the fault analysis, the behavior of each individual source is obtained when a fault occurred on its DC terminals. The study showed very valuable results and recommendations that should be considered in the protection schemes. The fault current magnitude and time constant are varied significantly for different sources and different interface topologies. Then, the fault response of all sources when connected to the DC microgrid is obtained and evaluated in comparison to the response of individual sources. Finally, the main features of fault response in DC microgrids are summarized and the main challenges for protection schemes are highlighted to be a framework for future studies in this issue.}

Specifically, we model a two-?‐ body point absorber and two oscillating surge devices. For each device we describe how the WEC-?‐Sim model was setup and present simulation results, such as predictions of device motions and power production.

	abstract = {The results of a comprehensive, 8-year wind resource assessment programme in Egypt are presented. The objective has been to provide reliable and accurate wind atlas data sets for evaluating the potential wind power output from large electricityproducing wind turbine installations. The regional wind climates of Egypt have been determined by two independent methods: a traditional wind atlas based on observations from more than 30 stations all over Egypt, and a numerical wind atlas based on long-term reanalysis data and a mesoscale model (KAMM). The mean absolute error comparing the two methods is about 10% for two large-scale KAMM domains covering all of Egypt, and typically about 5% for several smaller-scale regional domains. The numerical wind atlas covers all of Egypt, whereas the meteorological stations are concentrated in six regions. The Wind Atlas for Egypt represents a significant step forward in the application of the wind atlas methodology in Egypt. Not only does it provide a coherent and consistent overview of the wind energy resource over the entire land (and sea) area of Egypt, the results of the mesoscale modelling are further available in a database (numerical wind atlas) which may be employed directly for detailed wind resource assessments and siting of wind turbines and wind farms. Utilising this database together with elevation maps derived from the Space Shuttle Topography Mission and land-use maps constructed from satellite imagery, the wind resource and likely power production of a given wind farm can be estimated in a matter of hours – anywhere in Egypt. In addition to the very high wind resource in the Gulfs of Suez and Aqaba, the wind atlas has discovered a large region in the Western Desert with a fairly high resource – close to consumers and the electrical grid. The KAMM simulations seem to capture the main features of the wind climate of Egypt, but in regions where the horizontal wind gradients are large, the uncertainties are large as well and additional measurements are required. The results are now published in a Wind Atlas for Egypt.},
